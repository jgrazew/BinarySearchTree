# BinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree using built in pointers
 This is a recursive version of a Binary Search Tree that uses built in pointers. 
 This version of the Binary Search Tree can perform the basic operations of:
 inserting an element into the tree; deleting an element from the tree; searching for an element 
 and traversing the tree. 
 If I wanted to take my BST a step further I could add some auxiliary operations such as
 finding the tree size; finding the height of the tree and finding the level which has the max sum.
